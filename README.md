# Signup Redux

Signup Redux is a registration flow built in React and Redux. New accounts are submitted to an Express server and persisted to a MongoDB database.

To install and run locally, first ensure you have MongoDb installed and running.

From there, run `npm install && npm start` in both the root directory and `client` directories.

By default, Signup Redux runs on port 3000, and the API server runs on port 3001.
